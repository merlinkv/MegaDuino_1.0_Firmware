# MegaDuino Firmware 1.0 Readme

Original firmware writen by Andrew Beer, Duncan Edwards, Rafael Molina and others.

MegaDuino Firmware is an adaptation of the MaxDuino firmware by Rafael Molina and is specially designed for my MegaDuino PCB projects (Mega2560 & dual Mega2560/STM32).

MegaDuino Firmware have a different way of displaying information on OLED 128x64 1.3" (8 rows). Also you can use LCD 20x4 screens.

Thanks to the sixth button included in the MegaDuino project (board & components are cased) there is the possibility of deleting files or doing a reset of the board (whithout opening the case).
